Release Notes version 1 POC

Goal:
For the Proof of concept, I was to have a build
where the player can move around and stand on platforms,
as well as have a camera that follows the player throughout 
the world.

For proof of concept, I did NOT meet my goals. Platforms are
in the works but mainly the camera is where it did not come
together. Movement and gravity for my character is awkward 
since it was built around a bad input but fixable.
