For this build Gravity and the tilemap are my main issues that I need to sqaush.
Ive been building my progam off this od version of movement where gravity doesnt kick in 
until there is X (Key A, Key D) input. 
The tilemap I have an idea of how to set it up but 
it needs work. 

I have an enemy that roams an 'initial' postion and chases the player if 
they come within a certain range of the enemy. The enemy can run outside its initial postion when chasing
but it will return to the initial postition if the character gets out of range.

Collision on my Tiles I need to redoe because its a simple rectangle intersect method with no other logic.
I need to check a sprite NEXT location to determine whether it will collide with the tile or not, the side
of the tile OR the top of the tile.
